First pitfall:
The 'loop' in NASM 0.98.40 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 11), cannot be called 'loop'. It is a reserved word.

Second pitfall:
Graphics mode is default tty. Must change to draw

Third pitfall: 
vmware only takes floppies with sizes in multiples of 512 apparently.

Fourth pitfall:
times 512-($-$$) ... only works for the bootsector (510 for the BS really), in order to pad to 1k must do "times 1024-($-$$)" (This only applies when doing more than the boot loader in one file

Fifth pitfall:
ax needs to hold the video buffer. I was blowing it away.
