First pitfall:
The 'loop' in NASM 0.98.40 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 11), cannot be called 'loop'. It is a reserved word.

Second pitfall:
Graphics mode is default tty. Must change to draw

Third pitfall: 
vmware only takes floppies with sizes in multiples of 512 apparently.

Fourth pitfall:
times 512-($-$$) ... only works for the bootsector (510 for the BS really), in order to pad to 1k must do "times 1024-($-$$)" (This only applies when doing more than the boot loader in one file

Fifth pitfall:
WRONG WRONG WRONG! ax needs to hold the video buffer. I was blowing it away. WRONG WRONG WRONG!
--------
mov ah, 0x02 	;The Read sectors interrupt option.
mov al, 0x01	;The number of sectors to read

...
...

mov ax, 0x1000 	;The place we want to far jump to
mov es, ax 	;ES now contains the first part of our 16:16 address
mov bx, 0	;BX contains the second part
int 0x13
--------
What's wrong with this picture? AX is AH and AL. AH and AL are getting set up first of all, then reset to 0x0000 and 0x1000 respectively.

Move the first assignment after the second or don't do the second.
